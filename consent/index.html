                    <p>You believe that asking a woman for her permission before touching, fondling or penetrating her is not as important as your needs. You also believe that women are drama queens and want male attention all the time. Rapes, sexual harassment and crimes against women are committed by men who fall in the same category as you.</p>

                    <p>You might believe that men and women are equal, but you lack a deeper understanding of how to give a woman, any woman, the respect that she deserves. Our education system and patriarchal society are also to blame for this. You should educate yourself about 'consent' till you understand that there's no scope for ambiguity when a woman says 'no'.</p>
