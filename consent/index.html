  			<h3>I Just Don't Get It (0-20/100)</h3>
  			<p>You are the result of a highly patriarchal society, where the needs and desires of men are all that matter. Rapes, sexual harassment and crimes against women are committed by men who fall in the same category as you. Here's a chance for you to educate yourself – (we add a few hyperlinks to stories we've done around consent)</p>
  		</li>
  		
  		<li class="ans-2">
  			<h3>I Get It, But I Don't Really Care (20-40/100)</h3>
  			<p>You believe that a man has the right to treat a woman and her body the way he pleases. You see women as objects, meant to be at the receiving end of your ego and power. Rapes, sexual harassment and crimes against women are committed by men who fall in the same category as you. Here's a chance for you to educate yourself – (we add a few hyperlinks to stories we've done around consent)</p>
  		</li>
  		
  		<li class="ans-3">
  			<h3>Consent Is Overrated (40-60/100)</h3>
  			<p>You believe that asking a woman for her permission before touching, fondling or penetrating her is not as important as your needs. You also believe that women are drama queens and want male attention all the time. Rapes, sexual harassment and crimes against women are committed by men who fall in the same category as you.</p>
  		</li>
  		
  		<li class="ans-4">
  			<h3>Consent Is Ambiguous (60-80/100)</h3>
  			<p>You might believe that men and women are equal, but you lack a deeper understanding of how to give a woman, any woman, the respect that she deserves. Our education system and patriarchal society are also to blame for this. You should educate yourself about 'consent' till you understand that there's no scope for ambiguity when a woman says 'no'.</p>
  		</li>
  		
  		<li class="ans-5">
  			<h3>Consent Is Everything, It's Freedom (80-100/100)</h3>
  			<p>The world needs more men like you. You're right, consent is as important as freedom.</p>
