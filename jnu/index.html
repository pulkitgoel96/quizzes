        <p> Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said that the ‘government will not allow anyone to spread anti-national sentiment in the country.’ A BJP MLA talked of 3,000 condoms being found in the dustbins of JNU while prime time television debates focused on the university’s 'anti-national’ DNA.

        <p>In the middle of a fiery debate on sedition and nationalism, India turned to its media for answers, but found facts it couldn’t trust. The aftermath of JNU’s sedition row was a time when the Indian media’s credibility became a question rather than a statement.</p>
        <p>The JNU row seemed like a breeding ground for chaos – most notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAxWuDUpj1A" target="_blank">when journalists were roughed up by lawyers</a>, the other pillars of democracy, in Delhi’s Patiala House Complex.</p>

        <p>Azaadi. One word, many meanings. For some, it came to symbolise the <a href="https://www.thequint.com/jnu-sedition-row/2016/02/19/jnu-row-lawyer-who-led-attacks-at-patiala-court-felicitated" target="_blank">lack of regard that the younger generations of the extreme left</a> seemed to hold for the <a href="https://www.thequint.com/jnu-blogs/2016/02/26/jnu-row-the-right-to-freedom-of-speech-is-limited-by-common-sense" target="_blank">symbols of nationhood and patriotism</a>. </p>
        
        <p>And those who opposed these ‘disrespectful anti-nationals’, even through violence, found support for their actions and faced <a href="https://www.thequint.com/jnu-sedition-row/2016/02/24/a-tale-of-two-bails-kanhaiya-kumar-and-the-man-who-brutalised-him" target="_blank">minimal punishment</a>. There were even those who thought that the entire drama was blown out proportion, <a href="https://www.thequint.com/jnu-sedition-row/2016/02/20/an-open-letter-to-dsos-umar-khaled-from-a-jnu-alumnus" target="_blank">including actress and former JNU student Swara Bhaskar</a>. </p>
        
        <p>But for others, the word came to mean <a href="https://www.thequint.com/jnu-sedition-row/2016/03/03/kanhaiya-kumar-and-his-heros-return-to-jnu" target="_blank">hope for a better India</a>. </p>
        
        <p>An India free from caste, poverty, religious discrimination, and hunger. Accusations being of ‘anti-national’ were countered with ‘Nationalism Lectures’ held in the university’s Freedom Square. </p>
        
        <p>At midnight on 3 March 2016, Kanhaiya Kumar was released from prison. And the two meanings of ‘azaadi’ clashed in his speech; electrifying the country and strengthening the movement to get Umar Khalid and Anirbhan Bhattacharya released as well.</p>

        <p>From the Occupy UGC movement that began in November 2015, to the Rohith Vemula protests that sparked off after the Dalit student committed suicide in the University of Hyderabad, student movements had played out majorly in the news cycle preceding the JNU debacle. </p>

Guards are everywhere, and have been asked to shoot videos of ‘suspicious’ events. CCTV cameras keep a strict eye on students. And even professors have been sent notices to ‘follow the rules’, which includes not addressing students at the Administrative Block. Nivedita Menon, who teaches at the School of International Studies, is now facing an inquiry against her for one such address. </p>
        
       <p>  The university’s problems are far from over and the Vice Chancellor, M Jagadesh Kumar – who took over only a week before the February drama began to unfold – is still in the eye of storm as he faces criticism from students and teachers on his handling of the university. </p>

          <p>But when “Where is Najeeb?” slogans resonate in Freedom Square (now strewn with thorny potted-plants), it reflects the core of Jawaharlal Nehru University and its voice, still unafraid to speak out in dissent. </p><br><br>
