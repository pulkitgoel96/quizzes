               <p>“This country belongs to us all,” says Liaqat Ali, a resident of Ballabgarh, a town in Faridabad district in Haryana - the same town where a 19-year-old Junaid lived. Before he was brutally lynched while travelling on a train from Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar.</p>
               <h4>Because he was a Muslim.</h4>
               <p>Since 2010, 86% of victims who died in cow-related incidents in India were Muslims. Mob lynching has become the new ‘normal’ in India, its blood-fueled hatred spilling over into our political discourse, Twitter timelines and everyday lives. How has increased intolerance affected business, social relations and mindsets among Muslim community in India? Is the polarizing discourse restricted only to TV studios and newspapers or is there a pervading atmosphere of fear?</p>
               <p>What does it mean to be an Indian Muslim in 2017? The Quint speaks to Muslims across the country in cities in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi to get an answer.</p>

                  <p>A change in people’s attitudes, an atmosphere of fear, increasing intolerance and wariness of hate-mongering - most Muslims confess that after a spate of mob lynching incidents, there’s a prevailing sense of being under constant threat.</p>
                  <p>For some, the harshest impact of mob lynching in everyday lives is the transformation in the mindsets of non-Muslims, reflected best in ‘gau-raksha’ politics.</p>

But what does it mean to live in fear? To feel that the community you knew well, is now turned against you, and that anything you do maybe construed as ‘anti-national’?</p>

            <p>Majeed isn’t the only one who is watching TV debates, and taking clues on the communal tint of public opinion in India today. The media - with TV debates, newspaper reports and social media - play an essential role in determining a narrative of fear and hatred. For most Indian Muslims, TV channels and newspapers reports are the only way they are informed of violence against Muslims in across India. The manner in which mob lynching incidents, for instance, are reported shapes the larger narrative, and also how Indian Muslims view themselves in society. It’s inevitably the only way they get to know of the ‘truth’ about incidents of cow-related violence targeting Muslims.</p>
            <p>But in the age of fake news and Whatsapp, ‘truth’ is a fickle creature.</p>

            <p>For Mohammed Shamsi, a businessman in Moradabad, riots are a practical hindrance to doing business. It’s an opinion mirrored across the country, where businesses in small-towns are premised on good Hindu-Muslim relations. But in cities like Varanasi which are founded on a syncretic Hindu-Muslim culture, business knows no religion with the spate of violent mob-lynching incidents in the country having minimal effect on trade.</p>

         <p>Amina's family left Myanmar during the holy month of Ramzan that year. “I remember it was Ramzan, because mother and father had just finished their sehri," says 22-year-old Hussain Johar, Amina’s youngest son. "Then, at around 4 in the morning, we all left in a Bolero. Mother had packed tiffins for my sister and I, as we were too young to observe Roza. We reached Bangladesh in a boat.” </p>
         <p>Sifting through the various documents that are arranged neatly in folders, Hussain pulls out the leaf of paper that is his birth certificate. It’s written in Burmese, which Huzzain cannot read. “I don’t know Burmese. I ask my mother to show me my name in the document, my name and my date of birth. My siblings know the language because they studied it in Burmese schools.” </p>

      <p>Hussain’s elder brother, Ali, heads the UNHCR's Rohingya Refugee Committee in Delhi. Growing up, Ali always stood first in his class at school and won every competition he participated in. He has carefully preserved the certificates of his achievements, after all these years. He kept the folder on his person when he left Bangladesh in a bus, and when he crossed the borders on foot, to avoid the security forces on both sides. </p>

   <p>Ali’s sister, Tasmida, received primary education in Bangladesh. She was recently in the news for becoming the first Rohingya woman to appear for her Class X exams.
      <br> She shows the marksheet issued her by the Bangladesh primary education board. It is full of A+s, except for one subject.

<p>Eighty-year-old Tenzing Wangdue can talk for hours about Tibet. I was born there, I studied there, I was on the run when I was 22, he says, without pausing for air as he sits in his house in Majnu Ka Tila. </p>

<p>But did he bring anything with him from Tibet? “No.” But there’s got to be something. What about clothes? Family photographs? “In those days we didn’t take photographs,” he says, a reality that is hard to fathom for the Instagram generation. How is that possible? What about documents? “No,” he says, affirmatively. </p>
<p>He describes his home, Tibet’s pleasant weather, and the bountiful harvest. He talks about his siblings, and how they all left the country, one after the other.
</p>

<div class="container text-center">

“Our parents wanted all of us to leave Tibet. But, they stayed back and saw us leave one by one. Like scattered litter. I was very sad that I had to leave my parents behind.”

<p>An hour and a half into the conversation, Wangdue gets up, walks down the corridor to his room and returns with something in his hands. “This is what I brought with me,” he says.</p>

<p> Why this knife? “The journey was perilous and filled with uncertainty. I wasn’t sure if I would survive and how long I would survive for. I didn’t have the luxury to carry what I owned. I could not have brought many things with me on the trail or I would have invited attention. At that moment, the only thing that mattered was that I had to stay alive. Hence this knife.” </p>
<p>The knife is in a sheath and it is as good as new. It is the octogenarian’s most prized possession. He doesn’t let anyone touch the knife. “No,” he says.</p>
<p>In 1959, two days before he left Tibet, Wangdue purchased the knife from a local shop for Rs 200. His eyes light up with excitement as he talks about the knife, as his wrinkles fade to reveal the 22-year-old who left behind his family, his house, and all things familiar.
</p>
</div>
<div class="container text-center">
<blockquote>
“I tied the sheath knife around my waist and hid it under my clothes. It was for self-defence against any attacks. For days, I was on the road. Then I was on a boat. I finally arrived in Siliguri via train.”
</blockquote>

<p>He travelled from Siliguri to Delhi, and from Delhi to Dharamshala. He met his wife at the Tibetan Children's Village School, where he worked. The couple moved to Delhi, where they have lived for the last 25 years. They have seven children – four boys and three girls. All seven are married and have settled down in different parts of India. </p>
<p>What was Tibet’s and still belongs to him is the knife that he clutches with both hands. He now guards with his life the item that once guarded his. “I never sold it. This is what I brought with me. It’s because of this that I am alive.” </p>
